# Personal Portfolio - Cloud Technologies, Infrastructure as Code, and Full Stack Development

## Overview:

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository showcasing my expertise in cloud technologies, infrastructure automation, and full-stack development. This portfolio reflects my passion for leveraging cutting-edge tools and frameworks to build scalable, efficient, and modern applications.

## Key Technologies:

### Cloud Technologies (AWS):

I have hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing various services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, and more to deploy and manage cloud-based applications. The projects in this portfolio demonstrate my proficiency in designing robust and cost-effective cloud solutions.

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is at the core of my development workflow. I leverage Terraform to define, provision, and manage infrastructure in a declarative manner. This ensures consistency across environments and facilitates easy scalability.

### Full Stack Development:

#### Frontend - React.js:

My frontend development skills are showcased through projects built using React.js. These projects focus on creating interactive and responsive user interfaces, delivering a seamless user experience.

#### Backend - Node.js and Golang:

On the backend, I work with both Node.js and Golang to develop scalable and performant server-side applications. Whether it's handling API requests, implementing business logic, or optimizing performance, my backend solutions are designed for efficiency.

### DevOps and CI/CD:

I embrace DevOps practices to automate and streamline development workflows. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines play a crucial role in ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of software changes.
